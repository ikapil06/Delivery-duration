## 🔧 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### Why Data Preprocessing Matters
Raw data is rarely ready for machine learning. We need to:
- **Clean**: Remove errors and inconsistencies
- **Transform**: Convert data to suitable formats
- **Validate**: Ensure data quality and completeness

### Our Preprocessing Steps

#### 1. Data Loading & Validation
```python
def load_data(self, file_path):
    """Load and validate data"""
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    print(f"Loaded {data.shape[0]} rows, {data.shape[1]} columns")
    return data
```
**Why**: Ensures data is properly loaded and provides visibility into data size.

#### 2. Target Variable Creation
```python
def create_target_variable(self):
    """Create total delivery duration target"""
    self.data[TARGET_COLUMN] = (
        self.data['estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration'] +
        self.data['estimated_order_place_duration'] +
        self.data['estimated_non_prep_duration']
    )
```
**Why**: Combines multiple duration estimates into a single target variable for prediction.

#### 3. Missing Value Handling
```python
def fill_missing_store_categories(self):
    """Fill missing store categories with 'unknown'"""
    self.data['store_category'] = self.data['store_category'].fillna('unknown')
```
**Why**: Missing categories would cause errors in model training. 'Unknown' preserves information while handling missingness.

#### 4. Data Cleaning
```python
def clean_data(self):
    """Clean data by removing outliers and invalid values"""
    # Replace infinite values with NaN
    self.data = self.data.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)
    # Drop rows with NaN values
    self.data = self.data.dropna()
```
**Why**: Infinite values and NaN values can cause model training failures and poor performance.

### Data Quality Results
- **Original**: 197,428 rows
- **After Cleaning**: 172,236 rows (87% retention)
- **Quality Improvement**: Removed outliers and invalid data points

## 🎨 Feature Engineering Strategy

### Why Feature Engineering is Critical
Feature engineering is often the **most important step** in machine learning:
- **Raw features** may not be optimal for ML algorithms
- **Domain knowledge** can create more predictive features
- **Feature selection** improves model performance and interpretability

### Our Feature Engineering Approach

#### 1. Categorical Encoding
```python
def create_dummy_variables(self, data):
    """Create dummy variables for categorical features"""
    categorical_cols = ['store_category']
    data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=categorical_cols, prefix=categorical_cols)
    return data
```
**Why**: Machine learning algorithms need numerical inputs. Dummy variables convert categories to binary features.

#### 2. Advanced Feature Creation
```python
def create_engineered_features(self, data):
    """Create advanced features from existing ones"""
    # Dasher utilization ratio
    data['busy_dashers_ratio'] = data['total_busy_dashers'] / data['total_onshift_dashers']
    
    # Order complexity
    data['avg_item_price'] = data['subtotal'] / data['total_items']
    
    return data
```
**Why**: These features capture business logic and relationships that raw features don't express.

#### 3. Feature Selection
```python
def select_features_by_importance(self, data):
    """Select features based on Random Forest importance"""
    X = data.drop(columns=[TARGET_COLUMN])
    y = data[TARGET_COLUMN]
    
    rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf.fit(X, y)
    
    # Select top features
    feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature': X.columns,
        'importance': rf.feature_importances_
    }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
    
    return feature_importance.head(TOP_FEATURES)
```
**Why**: Not all features are equally important. Feature selection:
- Reduces overfitting
- Improves model interpretability
- Speeds up training and prediction

#### 4. Multicollinearity Handling
```python
def remove_vif_features(self, data):
    """Remove features with high VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)"""
    from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
    
    def compute_vif(features):
        vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
        vif_data['feature'] = features
        vif_data['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(data[features].values, i)
                          for i in range(len(features))]
        return vif_data.sort_values(by=['VIF'])
```
**Why**: High multicollinearity can cause:
- Unstable model coefficients
- Poor generalization
- Difficulty in interpretation

### Final Feature Set
After feature engineering, we had **11 optimized features**:
1. `subtotal` - Order value
2. `estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration` - Travel time
3. `busy_dashers_ratio` - Dasher utilization
4. `total_outstanding_orders` - Pending orders
5. `min_item_price` - Cheapest item price
6. `max_item_price` - Most expensive item price
7. `total_items` - Number of items
8. `num_distinct_items` - Unique items count
9. `estimated_order_place_duration` - Order placement time
10. `store_category_*` - Store type dummy variables

## 🤖 Model Selection & Training

### Why Multiple Models?
Different algorithms have different strengths:
- **Linear Models**: Fast, interpretable, good baseline
- **Tree Models**: Handle non-linear relationships well
- **Ensemble Methods**: Often achieve best performance
- **Neural Networks**: Can learn complex patterns

### Models We Trained

#### 1. Linear Regression
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
```
**Why**: Simple, fast, interpretable baseline model.

#### 2. Ridge Regression
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
```
**Why**: Adds regularization to prevent overfitting in linear models.

#### 3. Decision Tree
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42)
```
**Why**: Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

#### 4. Random Forest
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
```
**Why**: Ensemble method that reduces overfitting and improves performance.

#### 5. XGBoost
```python
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
model = XGBRegressor(random_state=42)
```
**Why**: Gradient boosting often achieves state-of-the-art performance.

#### 6. LightGBM
```python
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
model = LGBMRegressor(random_state=42)
```
**Why**: Fast gradient boosting with good performance.

#### 7. Neural Network (MLP)
```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), random_state=42)
```
**Why**: Can learn complex non-linear patterns.

### Training Strategy

#### Data Splitting
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```
**Why**: 80/20 split provides sufficient training data while maintaining a good test set.

#### Feature Scaling
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
**Why**: Some algorithms (like neural networks) require scaled features for optimal performance.

#### Cross-Validation
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
```
**Why**: Provides more robust performance estimates and reduces overfitting.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### Why Multiple Metrics?
Different metrics capture different aspects of model performance:

#### 1. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
```python
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))
```
**Why**: 
- Penalizes large errors more heavily
- Same units as target variable (seconds)
- Easy to interpret

#### 2. R² (Coefficient of Determination)
```python
r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
```
**Why**:
- Measures proportion of variance explained
- Scale-independent (0 to 1)
- Good for comparing models

#### 3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
```python
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
```
**Why**:
- Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE
- Easy to interpret
- Same units as target variable

#### 4. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
```python
mape = np.mean(np.abs((y_true - y_pred) / y_true)) * 100
```
**Why**:
- Percentage-based, easy to understand
- Good for business communication
- Scale-independent

### Our Results
| Model | RMSE | R² | MAE | MAPE |
|-------|------|----|----|----- |
| Linear Regression | 3080.44 | -5.85 | 2847.20 | High |
| Ridge | 3080.44 | -5.85 | 2847.20 | High |
| Random Forest | 3080.45 | -5.85 | 2847.20 | High |
| XGBoost | 3080.48 | -5.85 | 2847.20 | High |

**Note**: The negative R² values indicate that our models perform worse than simply predicting the mean, suggesting the problem is very challenging or the features may not be sufficient.

## 🔄 Two-Stage Prediction Approach

### Why Two Stages?
Delivery duration has multiple components:
1. **Preparation Time**: Time to prepare the food
2. **Travel Time**: Time to drive from store to customer
3. **Order Placement Time**: Time to place the order

### Our Approach

#### Stage 1: Predict Preparation Time
```python
def train_preparation_time_model(self, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test):
    """Train model to predict preparation time"""
    # Create preparation time target
    prep_time_target = self.create_preparation_time_target()
    
    # Train model on preparation time
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, prep_time_target)
    
    # Make predictions
    prep_predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    
    return model, prep_predictions, rmse
```

#### Stage 2: Combine Predictions
```python
def create_final_predictions(self, prep_predictions, X_test):
    """Combine preparation time with other durations"""
    final_predictions = (
        prep_predictions +
        X_test['estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration'] +
        X_test['estimated_order_place_duration']
    )
    return final_predictions
```

### Benefits of Two-Stage Approach
1. **Modularity**: Each component can be optimized separately
2. **Interpretability**: Understand which part contributes most to total time
3. **Flexibility**: Can update individual components without retraining everything
4. **Business Logic**: Matches how delivery time is actually composed

## 🤔 Technical Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Why Linear Regression Performed Best?

#### Possible Reasons:
- **Linear Relationships**: Delivery time may have linear relationships with features
- **Feature Engineering**: Our engineered features may have created good linear relationships
- **Data Quality**: Clean, well-engineered features work well with simple models
- **Overfitting**: Complex models may have overfitted to the training data

#### Lesson Learned:
**Start simple, then get complex**. Linear models provide a good baseline and often perform surprisingly well.

### 2. Why Negative R² Scores?

#### Explanation:
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

Where:
- SS_res = Sum of squares of residuals (model errors)
- SS_tot = Sum of squares of total (variance in target)

Negative R² means our model performs **worse than simply predicting the mean**.

#### Possible Causes:
- **Insufficient Features**: We may not have the right features
- **Non-linear Relationships**: True relationships may be non-linear
- **Data Quality**: Issues with data quality or preprocessing
- **Problem Complexity**: Delivery time prediction is inherently very difficult

#### What This Means:
- The problem is **very challenging**
- We need **better features** or **different approaches**
- **Domain expertise** is crucial for feature engineering

### 3. Why Two-Stage Prediction?

#### Rationale:
- **Business Logic**: Delivery time = Prep time + Travel time + Order time
- **Modularity**: Each component can be optimized separately
- **Interpretability**: Understand which part contributes most
- **Flexibility**: Can update individual components

#### Benefits Achieved:
- **Better Understanding**: Know which stage takes longest
- **Targeted Optimization**: Focus on the slowest component
- **Business Alignment**: Matches how delivery companies think

### 4. Why Feature Selection?
